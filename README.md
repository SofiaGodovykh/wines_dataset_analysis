# wines_dataset_analysis
Exploratory analysis of white wines dataset in R.

In this projest I exploped wines datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/numberswithkartik/red-white-wine-dataset) and found qualities specific for good and bad wines.
The wine dataset contains 5000 different wines with information of acidity, sugar, pH level, and other chemical parameters. Every wine is graded by critics according to its quality.

I explored how different parameters are associated with wine quality. I split wine quality for three categories: poor, average and good, and performed an analysis. In general, good wines contain more alcohol and volatile acidity, less chlorides, sulfur dioxide, density and sugar.

Cholrides and total sulfur dioxide both negatively affect wine grade. The interesting thing is that all the good wines have less than average of sulfur dioxide and cholrides at the same time.

Good wines tend to have more alcohol with one exception: combination of low ABV and high residual sugar.
